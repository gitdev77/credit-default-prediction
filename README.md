# credit-default-prediction
A machine learning project that predicts credit card payment defaults using real-world data. Built with logistic regression and scikit-learn.

# Credit Card Default Prediction 🚀

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to default on their credit card payment next month. The model is built using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📁 Dataset

**Source:** [UCI Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients)

The dataset contains details of 30,000 credit card holders in Taiwan, including:

- Demographic info (age, gender, education, marriage)
- Credit limit
- Past bill amounts
- Past payment behavior
- Whether they defaulted the following month (`default` column)


## 💡 Objective

To predict the `default` status of a customer using classification algorithms.  
This can help banks and lenders assess credit risk more accurately.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)
- scikit-learn (ML models)

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. Load and clean data (`.csv` converted from Excel)
2. Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns
3. Split into training and test datasets
4. Apply **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
5. Evaluate using accuracy, classification report & confusion matrix


## 📊 Results

- Achieved baseline accuracy of around **__%** (fill in your accuracy)
- Confusion matrix and classification report used to evaluate performance


## ✅ Future Improvements

- Try models like **Random Forest, XGBoost** for better accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web app using **Streamlit**
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
